ReInstagram is an application that uses React and Firebase to allow users to have an Instagram-like experience where they can upload and share photos.

### How It Works
* Since there is no authentication at this moment, the user can view and upload images to the existing library.
* To add a new image, click the + icon in the header.
* To view a full image, click the desired image and click anywhere in the backdrop to close the modal.

### Technologies Used
